//! `self-replace` is a crate that allows binaries to replace themselves with newer
//! versions or to uninstall themselves.  On Unix systems this is a simple feat, but
//! on Windows a few hacks are needed which is why this crate exists.
//!
//! This is a useful operation when working with single-executable utilties that
//! want to implement a form of self updating or self uninstallation.
//!
//! ## Self Deletion
//!
//! The [`self_delete`] function schedules a binary for self deletion.  On Unix the
//! file system entry is immediately deleted, on Windows the file is deleted after the
//! process shuts down.  Note that you should not use this function to be followed up
//! by a replacement operation, for that use [`self_replace`] as on Windows the file
//! will still be locked.
//!
//! ```
//! # fn foo() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
//! self_replace::self_delete()?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! On Windows self deletion requires some place in the folder the deletion is taking
//! place.  This will prevent the abiltiy of the program to also delete the folder the
//! executable is placed in.  To avoid this you can use the [`self_delete_outside_path`]
//! function which will ensure that the deletion does not take place in the path
//! provided if it's possible to do so.  That way you can delete entire structures safely.
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::fs;
//! # fn foo() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
//! let itself = std::env::current_exe().unwrap();
//! let parent = itself.parent().unwrap();
//! self_replace::self_delete_outside_path(&parent)?;
//! fs::remove_dir_all(&parent);
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Self Replacing
//!
//! This replaces the binary with another binary.  The provided path is copied over and
//! if the function successfully completes, you can delete the source binary.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::fs;
//!
//! # fn foo() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
//! let new_binary = "/path/to/new/binary";
//! self_replace::self_replace(&new_binary)?;
//! fs::remove_file(&new_binary)?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation
//!
//! The way this is implemented depends on the operating system.  On UNIX systems you
//! can usually not directly write into an executable, but you can swap it out which is
//! exactly what this is doing.  For deleting, the file is just unlinked, for replacing
//! a new file is placed right next to the current executable and an atomic move with
//! `rename` is performed.
//!
//! On Windows the situation is trickier because when an executable launches it can be
//! renamed, but it cannot be unlinked.  This means that we cannot clean up after
//! ourselves easily.  In either case, we first move our executable aside so the name
//! on the file system is made available for the new executable.  Then for both
//! deleting and replacing, we create a copy of our own executable first.  After this we
//! open that copied executable with `FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE`.  Then we spawn it and
//! wait for our own shut down.
//!
//! This library contains a special glue code that detects this copy of the executable
//! and does nothing else but waiting for the parent to quit and to then delete the
//! parent executable.  There is an extra hack in there in that it spawns another system
//! executable that stays alive until after we shut down to make the self deletion of
//! the copy work.  This is necessary because our running executable must not be the
//! last user of that file handle as otherwise the deletion won't work as the
//! executable still cannot be deleted.  Presumably this is because `CreateProcess`
//! and friends do not open the executable with `FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE`.
//!
//! **Special note on Windows:** the system will attempt to run the parent deletion logic
//! if the executable has the suffix `.__selfdelete__.exe`.  This means if you
//! name your executable `foo.exe.__selfdelete__.exe`, this logic would kick in.
//!
//! ## Alternatives for Windows
//!
//! Various proposals were made and tried for alternative solutions on Windows.  One
//! quite popular option is to spawn a batch file for the deletion job as a batch file
//! can self delete.  This could be used for both replace and self deletion, but it
//! has the disadvantage that this is a very racy and quite dirty approach as the batch
//! file cannot easily wait for the shutdown of the parent process.
//!
//! For just replaces, co-operation between parent and client could be implemented in
//! simpler terms where first the new executable replaces the old, and then on
//! startup replaces the new one.  There are two downsides of this approach: the first
//! is that it requires that the new replacing executable has matching logic for the
//! cleanup.  The second issue with this approach is that it requires either launching
//! the new executable or waiting for the executable to launch for natural reasons.
//! The former might not always be preferrable, the second leaves files lingering
//! around for an extended period of time.
//!
//! The third, and somewhat official solution is to use `MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT`
//! with `MoveFileEx`.  This causes windows to store an entry in the registry and
//! will perform the delete / move on restart.  This means that if a restart of the
//! machine does not happen, no cleanup is performed.  It also is a privileged
//! operation that is not available to all user accounts.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! Because files need to be placed temporarily on the file system, there is a chance
//! that if power is cut in just the wrong moment, some files are left over.  These
//! files resemble the original names of the executable prefixed with a dot (`.`) and
//! a random suffix.  The likelihood of this happening should be small.  It's not
//! recommended to run automatic cleanup on startup as the location of those temporary
//! files placed is left undefined.  In many cases the temporary files will be placed
//! in temporary locations and the operating system will take care of the deletion on
//! restart.
